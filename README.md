**The app was made in Interface Builder with `IBAnimatable` without a single line of code**. Due to the size of [the GIF file on Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/2453933-IBAnimatable-Design-App-Store-ready-Apps-in-Interface-Builder), it only demonstrates a subset of features. We can also find the full HD version on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvD8X6J1YLM) or [MP4 on Github](https://github.com/JakeLin/IBAnimatable-Misc/blob/master/Videos/IBAnimatable.mp4?raw=true)

![StoryboardPreview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JakeLin/IBAnimatable-Misc/master/IBAnimatable/Storyboard.jpg)

Here is the design in Interface Builder (Storyboard).

With `IBAnimatable`, we can design a UI in an Interface Builder like Sketch, and prototype animations in a Swift playground like Framer Studio. Also we can use the output of the design directly in the production ready App.

As a designer, we love Sketch, which is a simple but yet super powerful tool to design UI. However, Sketch can't design interaction, navigation, transition and animation, we may need another tool like Framer Studio to design some of them. Moreover, to make an App Store ready App, we need to use Xcode and Interface Builder to implement the UI and animations. To speed up the process and minimize the waste, we create `IBAnimatable` to make Interface Builder designable and animatable.   

## Languages
[中文](https://github.com/JakeLin/IBAnimatable/blob/master/Documentation/README.zh.md)

## Features
* From prototype to shippable App Store ready App - What you design in Interface Builder is what the App exactly looks like. 
* Designer friendly - Sketch style setting panel on Attributes Inspector to lower the learning curve for using Interface Builder.   
* Animation design support in Swift playground - Similar to Framer Studio, we can prototype animations in Swift playground to save time for running on simulator or actual iOS devices. 
* Built-in Auto Layout support - We can use Auto Layout and Size Classes with `IBAnimatable` to support orientations and multiple iOS devices. 
* Navigation and transition support - We can use default navigation pattern in the App and `IBAnimatable` also adds unwind segues to navigate back or dismiss scene without any code. More transitions will be added soon.
* Protocol oriented programming - `IBAnimatable` uses a protocol oriented programming paradigm. With Swift protocol extension, it is easy to support more designable or animatable features. We can even use these protocol extensions to create other custom UI elements instead of using the default ones from `IBAnimatable`.  

## Use cases
* Prototyping - Create interactive prototypes to validate ideas quickly.
* Redesigning in Interface Builder - Redesign UI from Sketch and animation from Framer Studio without writing any code.
* Making custom UI elements - Use `IBAnimatable` protocols to make custom UI elements. e.g. Buttons with a default color palette.

## Roadmap

## How to run the example App
The easy way to learn and understand how powerful of `IBAnimatable`is to run the example App and play around the settings in Interface Builder. Just few steps we can run the App as below:

1) Clone the repository

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/JakeLin/IBAnimatable.git
```

2) Open the workspace in Xcode

```bash
$ cd IBAnimatable
$ open IBAnimatableApp.xcodeproj
```

3) Compile and run the app in your simulator or iOS device

## How to design in Interface Builder
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JakeLin/IBAnimatable-Misc/master/IBAnimatable/DesignInInterfaceBuilder.png)

To use `IBAnimatable` to design the UI and animations in Interface Builder, just follow few steps as below:

1. Open a storyboard or Xib file.
2. Drag and drop a UIKit element e.g.. UIView to a ViewController.
3. In Identity Inspector, connect the UI element to `Animatable` custom UI class e.g.. `AnimatableView`, you can find all `Animatable` classes in [APIs section](https://github.com/JakeLin/IBAnimatable#apis).
4. Configure the UI and animations in Attribute Inspector.


## How to animate in Swift playground
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JakeLin/IBAnimatable-Misc/master/IBAnimatable/AnimateInSwiftPlayground.gif)

We can configure the animation settings in Attribute Inspector. However, Interface Builder doesn't support previewing Animations, but we can still prototype animations in Swift playground. There are three sample pages to demonstrate how to design animation in Swift playground. You can find them in [IBAnimatable.playground](https://github.com/JakeLin/IBAnimatable/tree/master/IBAnimatable.playground). 

1. Open IBAnimatableApp.xcodeproj
2. Select IBAnimatable Framework scheme and build it with `Command + b`
3. Select IBAnimatable.playground, select one page in Swift playground, then click on "Assistant editor" button to split the playground. After that, select "Timeline" on the top of right-hand side to preview the animation. We can use Xcode menu "Editor" -> "Execute" to re-run the playground.

## How to animate programmatically
As you saw above, we can prototype an App fully in Interface Builder without single line of code, but `IBAnimatable` also provides APIs to let us fully control the UI and animations. `IBAnimatable` provides simple APIs like `pop()`. We can simply call them in one line.

```swift
view.pop() // pop animation for the view
view.squeezeFadeInLeft() // squeeze and fade in from left animation
```  

You can play around with all these predefined animations in the [Swift playground Page - Predefined Animations](https://github.com/JakeLin/IBAnimatable/tree/master/IBAnimatable.playground/Pages/Predefined%20Animations.xcplaygroundpage)

### Animation properties
There are some properties we can change to customize the animation. What we need to do is to set the properties and call `animate()` method to start the animation.

```swift
// Setup the animation
view.animationType = "SqueezeInLeft"
view.delay = 0.5
view.damping = 0.5
view.velocity = 2
view.force = 1

// Start the animation
view.animate()
```

You can play around with all animations with different properties in the [Swift playground Page - Animation Properties](https://github.com/JakeLin/IBAnimatable/tree/master/IBAnimatable.playground/Pages/Animation%20Properties.xcplaygroundpage)

### Chaining animations
Sometimes, we need to run another animation after the previous one. With `IBAnimatable`, we can easily chain animations together to provide a sleek user experience.

```swift
// Simply put the next animation within `{}` closure as below. It is an example to pop the view after squeeze in from the top.
view.squeezeInDown{ view.pop() }

// Heaps of animations have been chained together, it is the source code of animated GIF in "Animate in Swift playground" section
view.squeezeInDown{ view.pop { view.shake{ view.squeeze{ view.wobble{ view.flipX { view.flash{ view.flipY { view.fadeOutDown() } } } } } } } }
```

## How to install

## APIs

### Animatable UI elements 
The easiest way to use `IBAnimatable` is to drag and drop UIKit elements and connect with `Animatable` UI elements in Identity Inspector. Here are the supported `Animatable` UI elements to map UIKit elements.

| UIKit elements | Animatable UI elements | Remark |
| ------------- |:-------------:| ----- |

### Designable protocols
`IBAnimatable` provides a set of Designable protocols as below. Because of the power of protocol oriented programming in Swift, we don't even have to use Animatable default UI elements e.g.. `AnimatableView` to unlocked the power of `IBAnimatable`. We can conform to `IBAnimatable` protocols to use the default implementation in protocol extension to create other custom UI elements.

## Inspirations
* `IBDesignable` and `IBInspectable` - The entire project is based on that.
* Sketch -  Interface Builder should be as easy as Sketch to use.
* Framer Studio - Design and preview animations in one place.
* [Spring by Meng To](https://github.com/MengTo/Spring) - steal a lot of animation parameters from this project.
* [Invision ToDo App UI Kit](http://www.invisionapp.com/do), The demo App's original design is from this UI Kit and redone in Interface Builder. We also added interaction, navigation and animations.
